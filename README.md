# Asteroid Gravity Simulation 🌍☄️

This project simulates the gravity of Earth acting on asteroids using Python and the Turtle module.

## 🌟 Features
- Realistic gravitational physics using Newton's law
- 1000+ asteroids with random sizes, directions, and colors
- Earth image as background
- Fast performance with `Screen.tracer()` optimization

## 🧠 How It Works
- Calculates gravitational acceleration:  
  `a = G * M / r²`
- Applies vector acceleration to asteroid speed
- Removes asteroids that collide with Earth

## 🚀 How to Run
1. Make sure you have Python 3 installed.
2. Place `Earth125.gif` and `bg.png` in the same folder as the script.
3. Run the script:
```bash
python gravity_simulation.py
